Module 5 Challenge -- Matplotlib Analysis

In this challenge, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Matplotlib were utilized to analyze pharmaceutical data.

The analysis was performed on data from animal studies testing the efficacy of various drug regimens on squamous cell carcinoma tumors in mice.

The analysis process entailed:
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Correlation and Regression Analysis
- Interpretation of Data

This repository contains one primary folder called Pymaceuticals. This folder contains:
- A Jupyter Notebook file, including a brief summary of observations from the data, follwed by data analysis and visualization as outlined above.
- A data folder, including the two initial csv files of mouse metadata and study results.
